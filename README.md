# Find if Path Exists in Graph
First I'll transform the given edge list into an adjacency list representation of the graph. Each vertex has a list of neighbors, and the size of the list is equal to the number of vertices in the graph. Then I'll set up a queue and  a set to perform a BFS algorithm. I created a queue to perform the breadth-first traversal. Nodes are enqueued and dequeued in the order they are discovered  and visited set to  keeps track of the nodes that have been visited to avoid processing the same node multiple times. The algorithm enters a loop that continues until the queue is empty. Inside the loop, it dequeues a node (node) from the front of the queue. If node is the destination vertex, the function immediately returns True because a valid path has been found. Otherwise, the algorithm iterates through the neighbors of the current node. If a neighbor has not been visited, it is marked as visited and added to the queue. If the BFS traversal completes without encountering the destination vertex, the function returns False. This indicates that there is no valid path from the source to the destination in the graph. <br />
Time complexity is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.<br />
Space complexity is is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.<br />

# Longest Cycle in a Graph
I'll try to find Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) in a directed graph. SCCs are subsets of nodes in a graph where each node is reachable from every other node within the subset. I'll uses DFS to identify SCCs in the directed graph. First I'll Perform a DFS on the reversed graph to obtain a reverse topological order of the nodes. Then I'll perform another DFS on the original graph, considering nodes in the reverse topological order obtained in the first step. During this DFS, I also keep track of the SCC with the maximum number of nodes (the one that forms the longest cycle). <br />
Time Complexity: O(n)  <br />
Space Complexity: O(n)  <br />

# Connecting Cities with minimum Cost
I'll start by sorting the edges of the graph based on their costs in ascending order. This ensures that the algorithm considers edges with the smallest cost first. Then I initialize a Union-Find data structure to keep track of connected components. Each node starts as its own component. After that, I iterate over the sorted edges and perform the following steps for each edge: Check if the nodes connected by the edge are already in the same connected component (have the same parent). If they are, skip the edge to avoid creating a cycle.
If the nodes are not in the same component, perform a union operation by merging the connected components. Add the cost of each selected edge to the total cost of the minimum spanning tree. Keep track of the remaining number of nodes. If all nodes become part of the same connected component, the minimum spanning tree is complete. If all nodes are connected, return the total cost of the minimum spanning tree. If not all nodes are connected after processing all edges, return -1, indicating that it's not possible to connect all nodes. <br />
The time complexity is O(n log n) because I used the built-in sorted function in Python which used Tim's sort.<br />
The space complexity is O(n)<br />
# All Paths From Source to Target
I'll use a depth-first search (DFS) to find all paths from the source node (0) to the target node in a directed graph. I'll use a stack called current_paths to store the paths being explored and an empty list all_paths to store the final output. Then I'll start by initializing the stack with paths that start from the source node (0). While there are paths in the stack (current_paths) then pop the last path (current_path) from the stack, check if the last node of the current path is the target node. If it is, add the path to the final output list (all_paths). If the last node of the current path has children (neighbors), explore each child: create new paths by appending each child to the current path. add these new paths to the stack for further exploration. Continue this process until the stack is empty, meaning all possible paths have been explored. <br />
